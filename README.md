# TuringConfig
TuringConfig handles the creation, saving, and loading of your configuration files using the classes you've already written for your project.

The project is in a very early alpha stage currently, but can be downloaded form NuGet [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TuringConfig/1.0.2)
